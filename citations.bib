abstract = "We propose a mapping to study the qualitative properties of continuous biochemical control networks which are invariant to the parameters used to describe the networks but depend only on the logical structure of the networks. For the networks, we are able to place a lower limit on the number of steady states and strong restrictions on the phase relations between components on cycles and transients. The logical structure and the dynamical behavior for a number of simple systems of biological interest, the feedback (predator-prey) oscillator, the bistable switch, the phase dependent switch, are discussed. We discuss the possibility that these techniques may be extended to study the dynamics of large many component systems. "

abstract = "Microarray chips generate large amounts of data about a cellâ€™s state. In our work we want to analyze these data in order to describe the regulation processes within a cell. Therefore, we build a model which is capable of capturing the most relevant regulating interactions and present an approach how to calculate the parameters for the model from time-series data. This approach uses the discrete approximation method of least squares to solve a data fitting modeling problem. Furthermore, we analyze the features of our proposed system, i.e., which kinds of dynamical behaviors the system is able to show. "

abstract={This paper develops a calculus for computing {Filippov's} differential inclusion which simplifies the analysis of dynamical systems described by differential equations with a discontinuous right-hand side. In particular, when a slightly generalized Lyapunov theory is used, the rigorous stability analysis of variable structure systems is routine. As an example, a variable structure control law for rigid-link robot manipulators is described and its stability is proved.},
